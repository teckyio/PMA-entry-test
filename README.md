# Tecky's Professional Mobile App(PMA) Entry Test

## Motivation
[This course](https://tecky.io/courses/PMA) is designed for students with experience in software development. It is assumed that students joining this course already know basic Javascript or other programming languages. If you donâ€™t have any programming experience, we recommend you to join our [Micromaster in AI and Programming](https://tecky.io/courses/MAP) to learn how to build a full stack software.

## Requirement
You need to build a Restful API that has the following structure:

|API| Sample Input | Sample Output|
|---|---|---|
|GET /students |`{}` | `[{name:"Ann",year:1,averageGPA:2.7},{name:"Peter",year:4,averageGPA:3.4}]` |
|POST /students| `{name:'John',year:2}` | `{updated:1}`|
|PUT /students/:id| `{id:2,name:'Ben',year:1}` | `{updated:1}`|
|DELETE /students/:id| `{id:2}` | `{updated:1}` |

On your server side, you can use the following as your 
sample data. Therefore there is no need for database.
Also it is not necessary to maintain a json file as the file
storage.

```json
{
    "students":[
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Ann",
            "year": 1,
            "averageGPA": 2.7
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Benn",
            "year": 2,
            "averageGPA" : 3.4
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Peter",
            "year": 4,
            "averageGPA" : 3.4
        }
    ]
}
```

A [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) file is also attached for clarification.

### Technology
The implemented should be done by NodeJS. It does not matter
which framework you make use of.

### Submission
We advise you to use [`CodeSandBox`](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard) to build your RESTful
API since it is the easiest way to share 
with us.Codesandbox allows you to build 
node right inside the browser.
